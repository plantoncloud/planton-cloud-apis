// this enum is encapsulated inside a message as a few entries like "name" (a reserved word in few languages) can only be added to the enum if it is inside a message.
// the recommended best practice to prefix the entry with enum name has been intentionally ignored to as the values of the entries are intended to be used to name resources.
